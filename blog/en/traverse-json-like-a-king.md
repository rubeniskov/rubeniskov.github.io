# Traverse json like a king

Nowdays is easy to imagine the manly used aplications arround the world handle object disposed as a tree due of its convinient easy interpretation but this becomes difficult for traverse through them to gatherer each node data.

For that reasong I recently made [traverse-json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/traverse-json), which provides many options to extends the capabilitites of the traverse.
